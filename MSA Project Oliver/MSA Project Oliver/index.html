                <h3>Game Postponed</h3>

                <h3>Quote of the Day</h3>
                <p>He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him and notice this, Harry. He chose, not the pureblood (which according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing), but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Quote of the Day</h3>
                <p>There are all kinds of courage, said Dumbledore, smiling. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.</p>
